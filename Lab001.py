2.Compiler & Interpretation difference

A Compiler takes a program as a whole.

The Compilers generate intermediate machine codes

Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++. 


An Interpreter takes single lines of a code.

The Interpreters never generate any intermediate machine codes.

Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code.

Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and MATLAB .
